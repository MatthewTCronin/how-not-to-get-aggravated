<p><pclass="intro" id="intro">Look... the world is a frustrating place. People lie, deadlines are impossibly short, there's this little international health crisis going on,
  and you're supposed to deal with all of it on your own. This site is NOT here to tell you your anger is invalid or unatural. But, you also do NOT
  need to shave your head and move to a monastery to find inner peace. Below are lists of simple ways to keep you from losing your temper with 
  obligatory persons, with beloved persons, and most importantly, with yourself. Give it a try. Why NOT?</p1>
